I like to create animations using manim. Often, i use OpenGL mobjects in my projects so make sure you add the `--renderer=opengl` flag in the command line. I'm neither professional nor a vibe coder, I just code something whenever i feel like it. Don't judge my code if it's poorly optimised:)
And feel free to give me ideas on ways to improve or something new to add
